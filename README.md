# redline proyecto universidad


Here you can see a project that I did at the university which has a lot of example code in the back of good quality that could be useful to novices but it contains bad practices but I will leave it as a memory in the front it has a lot of things but today in day they are also wrong or with a very bad code structure but again this code is when I started programming so I will leave it as free software that anyone who wants can try to understand
